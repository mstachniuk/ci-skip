= CI SKIP

GitHub Actions to skip build execution based on commit message

Sometimes there is a need to skip build on Continuous Integration (CI) server (GitHub Actions in this case),
e.g. to avoid many releases after several merges to master/main branch.
This is standard functionality well known in other CI systems, but missed in GitHub Actions.
That's why this is needed.

If the commit message (or merge message) contains `[ci skip]` the action will stop.
