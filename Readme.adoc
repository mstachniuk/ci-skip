= CI SKIP

GitHub Actions to skip build execution based on commit message

Sometimes there is a need to skip build on Continuous Integration (CI) server (GitHub Actions in this case),
e.g. to avoid many releases after several merges to master/main branch.
This is standard functionality well known in other CI systems, but missed in GitHub Actions.
That's why this is needed.

If the commit message (or a merge message) contains `[ci skip]` (in subject of body) the action will stop.

== Use cases

=== Simple fail fast

The simplest use case is to fail job fast after evaluating action.

[source,yaml]
----
on: [push]

jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          # The git history is needed for good evaluation of Pull Request commit messages.
          # By default this action checkout only last commit.
          # For PR it's temporary merge commit to current master and orginal commit message is missing.
          # For big projects can be set to 1000 for performance reasons.
          fetch-depth: '0'
      - uses: mstachniuk/ci-skip@master
        with:
          fail-fast: true
      - name: Verification
        run: |
          echo "The previous step should exiting with 42 code and this code should not run"
----

The action will immediately exit before `Validation` step returning exit code 42.
You can customize this exit code:

[source,yaml]
----
[...]
      - uses: mstachniuk/ci-skip@master
        with:
          fail-fast: true
          exit-code: 22
[...]
----

Now step will immediately exit with exit code 22.
If you don't like it, try fail-safe.

=== Fail safe

== Google Chrome Extension

If you would decide on merge to skip or not an action the https://github.com/mstachniuk/shipkit-chrome-extension[shipkit-chrome-extension] can be helpful.

== Alternatives

. https://github.com/veggiemonk/skip-commit/issues/5[Just use YAML]
It doesn't work for merge commits.
. https://github.com/marketplace/actions/skip-based-on-commit-message[Skip based on commit message]
It's a nice solution, but doesn't work on merge commits. And it's unamintained anymore.
. https://github.com/styfle/cancel-workflow-action[Cancel Workflow Action]
It can cancel jobs with a status of `queued` or `in_progress`.
